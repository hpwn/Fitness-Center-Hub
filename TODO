MAKE SURE THESE WORK AND WE AREN'T EMBARRASSED 👁️👄👁️:
-insertion
-deletion
-updating course packages
-queries
-basically everything!!!

todo:

all hands on deck:
-update insertion/deletion functions and make sure they correspond to tables since we've updated tables a few times (ex. inserting class, we added fields to class table)
-figure out what to do with the NULL course record in a package that results when a course is deleted using the functions

COLE/AUDREY:
-TESTING!
-add TAs to github for demo
