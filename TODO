continue to test:
-insertion
-deletion

todo:
-HAYDEN: implementing last two delete functions, then moving on to update functions
-update insertion/deletion functions and make sure they correspond to tables since we've updated tables a few times (ex. inserting class, we added fields to class table)

-COLE/AUDREY: start creating queries, create design.pdf (Hayden will provide (b)iv. once complete)

4 later:
-create file/class/function comments/documentation
-create readme
