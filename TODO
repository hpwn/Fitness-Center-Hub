-VERIFIED INSERTIONS WORK CORRECTLY

todo:
-HAYDEN: As per the spec: Adding a member begins with inputting the memberâ€™s basic information and
creating a new member entry. After this initial step, the system presents the contents and price of each
available course package for selection. Once a member selects a package, related records are updated to
reflect this choice.
    -So when we insert a member, we have to ask them for the package they want, and update other tables accordingly
      * This will require not directly inserting data into the member table, but rather gathering multiple pieces of data
        such as personal information and then package information, and THEN inserting into the member table and associated tables.

-COLE/AUDREY: create design.pdf (Hayden will provide (b)iv. once complete)

-create initial data with sql or just use jdbc system?
--curate initial data
--insert initial data
--finish implementing insertion function then do it from there?

-either way implement search function -> test asap

4 later:
-create file/class/function documentation
-create readme
