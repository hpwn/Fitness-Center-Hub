    This program is designed to manage records for a fitness center. It includes features to insert, delete,
    update, and query records in the system. Techniques such as object-oriented programming and exception
    handling are employed to manage the data effectively. 

    Operational Requirements:
    - Programming Language: Java
    - Special Compilation Information: None
    - Input Location: User input via console
    - Known Bugs: üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è

    The program aims to demonstrate the use of Java for building a simple record management system,
    focusing on basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
